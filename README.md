# Generic Angular Website #

This is a very generic angular website/app. Its purpose is to demonstrate the most common things a browser must do to render such an app.

## The Problem

The actual HTML (see index.html) is short and compact. Once rendered is larger and more complex. This rendering however is needed for:
* People to use the app
* Scrapers (like Google) to know the content
* Social media pages to get proper tags
